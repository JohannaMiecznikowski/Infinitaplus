This repository contains Python scripts that were written by Johanna Miecznikowski in 2023-2025 to process the transcripts of the TIGR corpus of spoken Italian.

The TIGR corpus contains 23 video recordings of face-to-face interaction in Italian, totalling 23.5 hours and 223'000 words. It was built at USI Università della Svizzera italiana from 2020 to 2025 by Johanna Miecznikowski (PI), Elena Battaglia (PhD collaborator), and Christian Geddo (PhD collaborator). Several student assistants helped transcribe, process transcripts, and process multimedia files: Costanza Lucchini, Benedetta Scotto di Santolo, Chiara Sbordoni, Simona Kaufmann, Tommaso Barenco, Alessia Blum, Giadamaria Valentino). The work was carried out within two research projects:
- "The categorization of information sources in face-to-face interaction: a study based on the TIGR-corpus of spoken Italian (InfinIta)" (Swiss National Science Foundation grant no. 192771) 
- "Sharing the TIGR corpus of spoken Italian: an ORD case study (ShareTIGR)", funded by USI Università della Svizzera italiana.

The corpus will soon be made accessible for academic research on the LaRS @ SWISSUbase repository.
