This repository contains Python scripts that were written by Johanna Miecznikowski in 2024 to process the transcripts of the TIGR corpus of spoken Italian.
The TIGR corpus was built at USI Università della Svizzera italiana from 2020 to 2025 within the research project "The categorization of information sources in face-to-face interaction: a study based on the TIGR-corpus of spoken Italian" (Swiss National Science Foundation grant no. 192771, principal investigator: Johanna Miecznikowski, PhD assistants: Elena Battaglia, Christian Geddo, student assistants: Costanza Lucchini, Benedetta Scotto di Santolo, Chiara Sbordoni, Simona Kaufmann, Tommaso Barenco, Alessia Blum, Giadamaria Valentino). 
The corpus has been submitted to the LaRS @ SWISSUbase repository to be made accessible for academic research.
